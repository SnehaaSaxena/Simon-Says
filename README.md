# Simon-Says
Simon Says is a fun, interactive memory game where players repeat sequences of colors or sounds shown by the game. With each level, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging, testing focus and recall. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is perfect for improving memory skills while having fun.
